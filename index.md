Hi, my name is Fabrizio Rizzi and I'm a web developer specialized in Front-end technologies.

I am a graduate of UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Brescia (Teorie e metodi per la gestione dell'informazione).

I've been working in IT for about 15 years and I currently live and work in Milan.

My focus area for the past few years has been front-end development with React and Angular, utilizing TypeScript.

I enjoy building everything from small web sites to rich interactive web apps.

During my spare time I like to play guitar, travel, read and ...codeðŸ¥³
